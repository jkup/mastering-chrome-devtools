# Introduction

### In this lesson we'll learn

- [The history of browser DevTools](#history)
- [The early tools for interacting with the DOM](#let-there-be-dom)

This course assumes zero prior understanding of the Chrome DevTools. So let's start at the very beginning!

Right click on a website and click **Inspect** or use the keyboard shortcut Command+Option+C (Mac) or Control+Shift+C (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS).

You should get something like this!
